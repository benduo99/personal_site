        <section class="h1"> Welcome! I'm Ben, </section>               
            an aspiring engineer and a current Mechatronics Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. Thanks for checking out my site and getting to know me. The snow on the homepage was not created by myself.  
        <br><br>
        I love designing solutions and prototyping. I believe that solutions should be robust, intuitive, and elegant. 
        <section class="d-none d-md-block">
            Ever since I was small, I started to design by transforming my 2D drawings into 3D Lego builds. Along with building giant snowforts with tunnels and chairs in the recess time of harsh Canadian winters and the reign of older kids (gotta protect your fort with slush), I really became a hands-on thinker that loved to imagine what could be.
        </section>
        <br>
        My current goals are to learn how to design for more manufacturing processes (vacuum forming and injection molding), how to design more organic components in CAD software, get better at surface modelling, and learn how to perform FEA.
        <br><br>
        If you're looking for a design freak that knows how to design around constraints and manufactuability, please contact me at: <a href="mailto:ben.duo99@gmail.com">ben.duo99@gmail.com</a>

        I'd like to consider myself to be a pretty well-rounded person, and I have many interests. I enjoy working with people and I'm not afraid to recieve the harsh truth or give it out either. I like to think that my friends can describe me as kind, funny, and smart. But none of them would like to admit it I think...
        <br>
        Below I'll introduce myself further and to my hobbies and I guess you can  judge for yourself!

         I think trying to stay healthy and fit is really important for my well being and my ability to work and think at my best. During school I enjoy partaking in various sports. I enjoy doing sports due to their competitive nature, engagement, and just their overall fun. Every term, I join the badminton club and play more 2/3 of their weekly sessions. I also do various intramurals such as Ultimate Frisbee and Indoor Volleyball where I enjoy playing with my friends and try not to be completely destroyed by teams way better than us. During co-op, I go to the gym regularly and I really want to get into rock climbing!

        I've been drawing for quite a while now. I started taking classes when I was extremely young, probably kindergarten or maybe even younger (can't quite remember). I've had multiple teachers that taught me different styles. I no longer take the lessons because of school and relocation during coop but I still paint as an creative outlet in my spare time.
        <br><br>
        Below are a few paintings I have to showcase (some I no longer have and are in different countries).

        Every Good Ben Deserves Fudge -- except when he's in treble... Bad puns? well I had some more but I guess they'd fall flat. I've been pretty in tune (hehe, you thought I'd stop?), with music for most of my life. I started piano in elementary school and continued though high school until my lessons confilicted with my school's orchestra. I played the viola for my middle and high school orchestras and on the way learned some violin. I'd love to learn the cello and some wind intruments such as the saxaphone. 
        <br><br>
        I love listening to many genres of music in the background for most things I do. Some of these genres include: Classical, Jazz, Lofi, EDM, Kpop, some Pop, and Soundtracks from film, games, and anime. I think I'm more picky about the theme and style of a song more than it's genre.

        <section class="h2">Technology.</section>
        I love to stay in touch with the latest phones, laptops, PC components, and gadgets. Technology is the reason I strive to be an engineer, to push the boundaries of what could be possible and improve daily life. I wake up hoping that a product I helped design will generate conversation and hype around it. As a student, I need to budget and so I'm usually not up to date with the trends. But when I'm older I think I'd sink a lot of money into the newest and coolest.

        <section class="h2">I play games.</section>
        I enjoy playing games when I have some free time where I can't sink into my other outlets. I love games that challenge the mind both in strategy and reflexes, or maybe just creativity. Here are some games that I really enjoy playing:
        <br><br>
        Sid Meier's Civilization V/VI: These games are an amazingly simplified simulation of the world with fun strategy mechanics.
        <br><br>
        League of Legends: Probably my most played game. But since it's free its been a great social outlet especially when I'm far away from my friends. I love its competitiveness, its micro management, awareness, and mechanics necessary to be a great player.
        <br><br>
        Cities Skylines: This is my go to game when my brain has burned out. Managing and building a city without any external pressure is really fun and still very engaging.
